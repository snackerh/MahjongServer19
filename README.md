# MahjongServer19

**MahjongServer19** is a JAVA server application used in mahjong that accepts 4 players at once.
This repository is closely related to **Mahjong Net Client**(which can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/snackerh/mahjongNetClient)), so check out both repository if you are willing to contribute. Thanks in advance.

This application has some limitations, though. 

1. You need to forward the port if you are using a router. (outer port = 9502, inner port = 9004)
2. (Client side problem) Same ID or position can't be used.
3. You cannot open 2 servers at once, so running more than 2 servers simultaneously isn't possible for now. (Currently in mind to expand the server capacity to accpet more than 4Ã—2 players)
